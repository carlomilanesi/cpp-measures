TODO:
- How to create a C array of measures, or a C++ vector of measures,
  using the values contained in an Eigen Vector or and Eigen Matrix, or a C array of numbers, or a C++ vector of numbers?
- Which operations can I do with an Eigen Vector o Matrix containing a measure?
- Improve comments inside "measures.hpp".
- Complete Tutorial, in particular:
  - Describe possible conversions between kinds of measure.
  - Add some examples of interface with Eigen.
- Complete Motivation.
- Complete Reference, in particular:
  - Add many examples of custom definitions.
- Complete tests.
- Rewrite static_checker using LLVM.
- Read document about open source software development.
- When completed, add Motivation as an article of CodeProject and as an article of http://www.academia.edu/.
- Search for units-related articles and then add announcement on C++ forums:

- add documentation specifying how to set and run tests
- test under linux with gcc and clang
- test quaternions and complex numbers.
- possibly allow mixed types in assignment operators (like vect1<inches,float>(3) += vect1<inches,double>(4))
